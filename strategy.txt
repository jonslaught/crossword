Strategy:

- If you have a NYT account, you can host a "room"

- The room loads in a puzzle client-side, using your cookies
- If you don't have the cookie, it warns you saying "sorry, you need an NYT account. log in here!" --> could even pop up a thingy

- The puzzle gets inserted server side, so anyone who joins the room can play now
- There's a unique ID of the puzzle in the URL. Anyone you send that to can play with you.

- The host sees a listing of
  
  Date
  Day of week
  Completed?
  Puzzle metadata? - do a one time scrape

  Organized by

  In progresss (ie active rooms), with resume buttons
  Latest (just list 50 for now), with completed ones shaded
  Filter by day
  Type in a date box
